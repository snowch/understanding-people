# Understanding people

A science-informed guide to understanding what drives people—including ourselves.

[Read the book](https://snowch.github.io/understanding-people/) · [Contents](contents.md) · [Evidence standards](evidence.md)

This is the initial editorial draft: an introduction, a broad chapter plan, two developed sample chapters, a practical worksheet, and an annotated source list. Planned chapters are explicitly labelled; this is not a completed or externally reviewed textbook.

The book draws on psychology, sociology, anthropology and decision science. Examples span work, friendship, family life, learning, public life and commercial decisions. Investigative interviewing and deception are assessed against evidence, including the limits of claims associated with the FBI.

## Build

Requires Python 3.11 or later.

```sh
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 scripts/build.py
python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory _site
```

Open http://localhost:8000. The build checks every generated local link and fragment. Static HTML, relative URLs and CSS work under the GitHub Pages project path without JavaScript or external fonts.

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` validates pull requests and publishes pushes to `main` through GitHub Actions. GitHub Pages must use **GitHub Actions** as its source.

## Writing

Edit the Markdown files. Register new pages in `PAGES` in `scripts/build.py` and update `contents.md`. Cite research beside the claim it supports and add an annotated entry in `references.md`. Distinguish research findings, interpretations and practical suggestions. All scenarios are fictional teaching examples, not evidence.
